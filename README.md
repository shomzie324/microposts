# My Notes
This is a practice javascript project that uses Brad Traversey's Babel Webpack Starter to work with es6 syntax and compile it down to es5. The application is a posts archive that uses JSON server to simulate a back end api. Notes for the Babel Webpack starter are below. 

# Start Up Notes
1. download or clone repo
2. Run the following command to install dependencies: "npm install"
3. Open a new terminal windows. Run the command "npm run json:server" on it while in the project to start the local back end API
4. Open a new terminal window (or do this in the current terminal). Run the command "npm start" to start the app on localhost port 8080.

# What I did
I used the course as a reference to build all of the javascript and debugged as needed.
